# Weather-App
I used a free weather API called ACcuWeather to get the weather information of cities using a mixture of asynchronous techniques already learned as well as some DOM manipulations to display data on the browser page.

# scripts
I created two javascript files in a script folder to separate the js file interacting with the DOM from that which will handle the api calls.

# local storage
set the local storage to store the value of the last city inputed on the page.
